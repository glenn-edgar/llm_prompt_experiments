Approach 1: Local Script with Persistent Instructions
Run a Python script locally that holds the instructions and structure in memory, prompting the user for sentences interactively. This way, the instructions are sent only once per API call, but the script itself handles the ad hoc nature without repeating them to the user.
Modified Python Script
python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import json

# Fetch the API key from the environment
api_key = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("XAI_API_KEY not set. Run 'export XAI_API_KEY=your_key' in your terminal.")

# Initialize the client
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key, base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1")

# Predefined structure
default_structure = {
    "verbs": {
        "Paint": {"objects": ["house", "car"], "adverbs": ["quickly", "carefully"]},
        "Run": {"objects": ["race", "track"], "adverbs": ["fast", "slowly"]}
    },
    "objects": {
        "house": ["red", "big"],
        "car": ["blue", "small"],
        "race": ["long", "short"],
        "track": ["wide", "narrow"]
    }
}

# Constant instructions
instructions = """
Parse each input sentence in the form 'verb object [adverb/adjective]' and return a list of JSON structures. 
- Verify terms against the provided structure.
- Correct misspelled words to the closest supported term.
- Include invalid attributes with 'match' fields to flag errors.
- Output format for each sentence: 
  {
    "sentence": "<original>",
    "verb": {"text": "<verb>", "attributes": {"adverb": "<adverb>"} or {}, "match": true/false},
    "object": {"text": "<object phrase>", "noun": "<noun>", "attributes": {"adjective": "<adjective>"} or {}, "match": true/false},
    "words": ["<word1>", "<word2>", "<word3>"],
    "length": <int>,
    "match": true/false
  }
Use the provided structure. Return only the JSON list.

# Function to process sentences
def get_grok_response(sentences, structure=default_structure):
    try:
        prompt = f"{instructions}\nStructure:\n{json.dumps(structure, indent=2)}\nInput sentences:\n" + "\n".join(sentences)
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="grok-beta",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=1000,
            temperature=0.0
        )
        response_text = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        return json.loads(response_text)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return {"error": "Invalid JSON response", "raw": response_text}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Error from Grok: {str(e)}"}

# Interactive loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enter a sentence to process (or 'quit' to exit).")
    while True:
        try:
            sentence = input("> ").strip()
            if sentence.lower() == "quit":
                break
            if not sentence:
                print("Please enter a sentence.")
                continue
            
            # Process single sentence as a list
            grok_response = get_grok_response([sentence])
            print(json.dumps(grok_response[0], indent=2))  # Print first item since it’s a list
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
How It Works
Interactive Prompt: The script runs a loop, asking the user for a sentence whenever they’re ready.
Single Sentence per Request: Each input is sent as a one-item list, and I return a JSON list with one object, which is then unpacked.
No Instruction Repetition for User: The instructions and structure are defined once in the script and sent with each API call, but the user doesn’t see or retype them.
Ad Hoc Timing: The user can think as long as they want between inputs.
Example Run
Enter a sentence to process (or 'quit' to exit).
> Run rase sloowly
{
  "sentence": "Run rase sloowly",
  "verb": {
    "text": "Run",
    "attributes": {
      "adverb": "slowly"
    },
    "match": true
  },
  "object": {
    "text": "race",
    "noun": "race",
    "attributes": {},
    "match": true
  },
  "words": ["Run", "rase", "sloowly"],
  "length": 3,
  "match": true
}
> (user thinks for a minute)
> Paint house red
{
  "sentence": "Paint house red",
  "verb": {
    "text": "Paint",
    "attributes": {},
    "match": true
  },
  "object": {
    "text": "house red",
    "noun": "house",
    "attributes": {
      "adjective": "red"
    },
    "match": true
  },
  "words": ["Paint", "house", "red"],
  "length": 3,
  "match": true
}
> quit
Pros
Simple to use, no file edits needed.
User controls the pace.
Instructions stay in the script, not repeated in the terminal.
Cons
Instructions are still sent with each API call (unavoidable with a stateless API), but this is hidden from the user.
Approach 2: Preload Instructions in a Configuration File
If you want to minimize API payload size, store the instructions and structure in a separate file, load them once, and send a shorthand reference. This assumes I can recognize a predefined instruction set by name (a hypothetical feature—real implementation depends on xAI’s API).
Script with Config File
Create config.json:
json
{
  "instructions": "Parse each input sentence in the form 'verb object [adverb/adjective]' and return a list of JSON structures. Verify terms against the provided structure. Correct misspelled words. Include invalid attributes with 'match' fields. Output format: {'sentence': '<original>', 'verb': {'text': '<verb>', 'attributes': {'adverb': '<adverb>'} or {}, 'match': true/false}, 'object': {'text': '<object phrase>', 'noun': '<noun>', 'attributes': {'adjective': '<adjective>'} or {}, 'match': true/false}, 'words': ['<word1>', '<word2>', '<word3>'], 'length': <int>, 'match': true/false}. Use the provided structure. Return only the JSON list.",
  "structure": {
    "verbs": {
      "Paint": {"objects": ["house", "car"], "adverbs": ["quickly", "carefully"]},
      "Run": {"objects": ["race", "track"], "adverbs": ["fast", "slowly"]}
    },
    "objects": {
      "house": ["red", "big"],
      "car": ["blue", "small"],
      "race": ["long", "short"],
      "track": ["wide", "narrow"]
    }
  }
}
Modified Script:
python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import json

# Fetch the API key
api_key = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("XAI_API_KEY not set.")

# Initialize the client
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key, base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1")

# Load config once
with open("config.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)
    instructions = config["instructions"]
    structure = config["structure"]

# Function to process sentences
def get_grok_response(sentence):
    try:
        prompt = f"{instructions}\nStructure:\n{json.dumps(structure, indent=2)}\nInput sentences:\n{sentence}"
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="grok-beta",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=500,
            temperature=0.0
        )
        return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content.strip())[0]
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        return {"error": "Invalid JSON", "raw": str(e)}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Error from Grok: {str(e)}"}

# Interactive loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enter a sentence (or 'quit' to exit):")
    while True:
        sentence = input("> ").strip()
        if sentence.lower() == "quit":
            break
        if sentence:
            response = get_grok_response(sentence)
            print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
How It Works
Config File: Instructions and structure are loaded once from config.json.
Ad Hoc Input: User enters sentences whenever they want, and the script sends them one at a time.
Output: Pure JSON per request.
Pros
Instructions are modular and reusable across scripts.
User experience is clean and interactive.
Cons
Still sends instructions per API call unless xAI supports a shorthand (e.g., “use config ID 123”).
Best Fit for Your Scenario
Approach 1 is ideal for your ad hoc, user-driven case:
It’s simple, interactive, and doesn’t require file edits between requests.
The user can think between inputs, and the script waits patiently.
Instructions are hidden from the user, even if sent to the API each time.
If xAI ever adds a way to store instructions server-side (e.g., via a session or config endpoint), we could eliminate repetition entirely. For now, Approach 1 minimizes user friction.
Try It
Save the first script, run it, and type sentences whenever you’re ready. Does this match your workflow? Let me know if you want adjustments!
