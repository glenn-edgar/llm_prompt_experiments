#### first set of instructions

design a python module which has the following functions

Start_Definition()
Initializes the Definition Dictionary

Define_Action_Functions( List_of_Action_Functions)
Defines a list of Action Functions which can be used
Must be the first function that is called after Start_Definition

Start_Verb_Definition( Name, Help_String, Action_Function )
Name - String
Help_String - String
Action_function -String

The Function cannot be called within a Start_Verb_Definition 
The Function can be called once an End_Verb_Definitin or End_Object_Definition is called

This function adds to the definition dictionary an entry with key the Name Variable and the entry a dictionary with the fields
    name - string
     help -string
     action - string
      objects -- empty dictionary
      adjectives -- empty dictionary
Note the dictionary entry must not have been previously defined

End_Verb_Definition()
  -- clears verb definition and allows new verbs to be defined
End_Definition()
  -- Definition Dictionary is returned as a json object

Generate Python code with naming and variable names according to Python Style Guide

     

#### second set of instructions

Add the following functions

Add_Adverb(name,description)
   This function is valid only during verb definition
   This function added to the adverb list of the verb definition a dictionary element
     entry  name,   name must not be previously defined
     dictionary element
         name - name
         description -- description
              Note description field can be blank  
           
#### Third Set of Instructions
Add the following functions



Define_Object( name, description )
  Will add an entry to the verbs object dictionary the following entry
   name name
   description description
   adjective empty dictionary
   name must be unique to the in the object dictionary 
   
   Define_Object cannot be called again until End_Object is called
   Also End_Verb cannot be called until End_Object is called

Add_Adjective(name,description)
    function adds an entry to the adjective dictionary field of object
     entry must not have been previously called
      Function can only be called in the scope of Define Object
End_Object_Defintion()
   Terminates Object Definition context

In the function 

 def add_adverb(self, name, description):
        """Add an adverb to the current verb's adjectives dictionary."""
        if not self._is_defining_verb:
            raise DefinitionError("Can only add adverbs during an active verb definition.")
        if self._is_defining_object:
            raise DefinitionError("Cannot add adverbs while defining an object.")
        if not isinstance(name, str) or not isinstance(description, str):

        if name in current_adjectives:
            raise DefinitionError(f"Adverb '{name}' is already defined for verb '{self._current_verb}'.")
        
        current_adjectives[name] = {
            "name": name,
            "description": description
        }

self._definition_dict[self._current_verb]["adjectives"] should be self._definition_dict[self._current_verb]["adverbs"]

This affects the define_verb function
