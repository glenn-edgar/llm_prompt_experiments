Instructions for Grok: Parsing Verb-Object Sentences with Attributes
Overview
Grok will parse input sentences in the form "verb object [adverb/adjective]" (e.g., "Paint house red," "Run race quickly") and generate a JSON structure. The parsing will:
Verify terms against a predefined structure of supported verbs, objects, adverbs, and adjectives.
Correct misspelled words by mapping them to the closest supported term.
Include invalid adverbs or adjectives in the output, using "match" fields to flag errors.
Output a JSON object for each sentence with detailed entity breakdowns.
Predefined Structure
Grok will use a structure defining:
Supported Verbs: Each with a list of supported objects and adverbs.
Supported Objects: Each with a list of supported adjectives.
If no structure is provided by the user, use this default:
Verbs:
"Paint": Objects: ["house", "car"]; Adverbs: ["quickly", "carefully"]
"Run": Objects: ["race", "track"]; Adverbs: ["fast", "slowly"]
Objects and Adjectives:
"house": ["red", "big"]
"car": ["blue", "small"]
"race": ["long", "short"]
"track": ["wide", "narrow"]
Input Assumptions
Sentences are in "verb object" form, optionally followed by one adverb or adjective.
Words are space-separated.
No explicit subject (implied, e.g., "you" in imperative form).
Parsing Steps
For each input sentence:
Split the Sentence:
Break into individual words (e.g., "Paint house red" → ["Paint", "house", "red"]).
Assume:
Word 1: Verb
Word 2: Object (noun)
Word 3 (if present): Adverb or adjective
Correct Misspellings:
For each word, compare against supported terms in the structure.
If a word is close to a supported term (e.g., "Paitn" ≈ "Paint," "rase" ≈ "race"), correct it to the supported term. Use simple heuristics (e.g., letter similarity).
Keep the original word in the "words" field, use the corrected term in "text" or "attributes."
Identify Entities:
Verb:
Take the first word (corrected if misspelled).
If a third word exists and modifies the verb (e.g., "quickly" in "Run race quickly"), treat it as an adverb.
Object:
Take the second word (corrected if misspelled) as the noun.
If a third word exists and modifies the noun (e.g., "red" in "Paint house red"), treat it as an adjective.
Verify Against Structure:
Verb:
Check if the verb is in the supported list.
If an adverb is present, check if it’s supported for that verb.
Object:
Check if the noun is a supported object for the verb.
If an adjective is present, check if it’s supported for that noun.
Build JSON Output:
For each sentence, create an object with:
sentence: The original input string.
verb:
"text": The corrected verb.
"attributes": {"adverb": "<adverb>"} if an adverb is present (valid or invalid), otherwise {}.
"match": true if the verb is supported and the adverb (if present) is supported for that verb; false otherwise.
object:
"text": The full object phrase (noun + adjective if present, e.g., "house red").
"noun": The corrected base noun.
"attributes": {"adjective": "<adjective>"} if an adjective is present (valid or invalid), otherwise {}.
"match": true if the noun is supported for the verb and the adjective (if present) is supported for that noun; false otherwise.
words: Array of original words from the input.
length: Number of words.
match: true if both verb and object "match" fields are true; false otherwise.
Example Processing
Input: "Paitn house red"
Split: ["Paitn", "house", "red"]
Correct: "Paitn" → "Paint"
Entities:
Verb: "Paint", no adverb
Object: "house" with adjective "red"
Verify:
"Paint" is supported, no adverb: Verb match: true
"house" is supported for "Paint," "red" is supported for "house": Object match: true
Output:
json
{
  "sentence": "Paitn house red",
  "verb": {
    "text": "Paint",
    "attributes": {},
    "match": true
  },
  "object": {
    "text": "house red",
    "noun": "house",
    "attributes": {
      "adjective": "red"
    },
    "match": true
  },
  "words": ["Paitn", "house", "red"],
  "length": 3,
  "match": true
}
Input: "Run race sloowly"
Split: ["Run", "rase", "sloowly"]
Correct: "rase" → "race," "sloowly" → "slowly"
Entities:
Verb: "Run" with adverb "slowly"
Object: "race", no adjective
Verify:
"Run" is supported, "slowly" is supported for "Run": Verb match: true
"race" is supported for "Run," no adjective: Object match: true
Output:
json
{
  "sentence": "Run rase sloowly",
  "verb": {
    "text": "Run",
    "attributes": {
      "adverb": "slowly"
    },
    "match": true
  },
  "object": {
    "text": "race",
    "noun": "race",
    "attributes": {},
    "match": true
  },
  "words": ["Run", "rase", "sloowly"],
  "length": 3,
  "match": true
}
Input: "Paint car loud"
Split: ["Paint", "car", "loud"]
Correct: No corrections needed
Entities:
Verb: "Paint", no adverb
Object: "car" with adjective "loud"
Verify:
"Paint" is supported, no adverb: Verb match: true
"car" is supported for "Paint," but "loud" isn’t supported for "car": Object match: false
Output:
json
{
  "sentence": "Paint car loud",
  "verb": {
    "text": "Paint",
    "attributes": {},
    "match": true
  },
  "object": {
    "text": "car loud",
    "noun": "car",
    "attributes": {
      "adjective": "loud"
    },
    "match": false
  },
  "words": ["Paint", "car", "loud"],
  "length": 3,
  "match": false
}
Notes
If the user provides a custom structure, override the default with it.
For unsupported verbs or objects, include them in "text" with match: false.
Misspelling corrections are best-effort; prioritize supported terms.
