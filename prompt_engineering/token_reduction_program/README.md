## Original Text
> *parse input sentences in the form "verb object [adverb/adjective]" (e.g., "Paint house red," "Run race quickly") and generate a JSON structure. The parsing will:  
> Verify terms against a predefined structure of supported verbs, objects, adverbs, and adjectives.  
> Correct misspelled words by mapping them to the closest supported term.  
> Include invalid adverbs or adjectives in the output, using "match" fields to flag errors.  
> Output a JSON object for each sentence with detailed entity breakdowns.  
> Predefined Structure  
> Grok will use a structure defining:  
> Supported Verbs: Each with a list of supported objects and adverbs.  
> Supported Objects: Each with a list of supported adjectives.  
> If no structure is provided by the user, use this default:  
> Verbs:  
> "Paint": Objects: ["house", "car"]; Adverbs: ["quickly", "carefully"]  
> "Run": Objects: ["race", "track"]; Adverbs: ["fast", "slowly"]  
> Objects and Adjectives:  
> "house": ["red", "big"]  
> "car": ["blue", "small"]  
> "race": ["long", "short"]  
> "track": ["wide", "narrow"]  
> Input Assumptions  
> Sentences are in "verb object" form, optionally followed by one adverb or adjective.  
> Words are space-separated.  
> No explicit subject (implied, e.g., "you" in imperative form).  
> Parsing Steps  
> For each input sentence:  
> Split the Sentence:  
> Break into individual words (e.g., "Paint house red" → ["Paint", "house", "red"]).  
> Assume:  
> Word 1: Verb  
> Word 2: Object (noun)  
> Word 3 (if present): Adverb or adjective  
> Correct Misspellings:  
> For each word, compare against supported terms in the structure.  
> If a word is close to a supported term (e.g., "Paitn" ≈ "Paint," "rase" ≈ "race"), correct it to the supported term. Use simple heuristics (e.g., letter similarity).  
> Keep the original word in the "words" field, use the corrected term in "text" or "attributes."  
> Identify Entities:  
> Verb:  
> Take the first word (corrected if misspelled).  
> If a third word exists and modifies the verb (e.g., "quickly" in "Run race quickly"), treat it as an adverb.  
> Object:  
> Take the second word (corrected if misspelled) as the noun.  
> If a third word exists and modifies the noun (e.g., "red" in "Paint house red"), treat it as an adjective.  
> Verify Against Structure:  
> Verb:  
> Check if the verb is in the supported list.  
> If an adverb is present, check if it’s supported for that verb.  
> Object:  
> Check if the noun is a supported object for the verb.  
> If an adjective is present, check if it’s supported for that noun.  
> Build JSON Output:  
> For each sentence, create an object with:  
> sentence: The original input string.  
> verb:  
> "text": The corrected verb.  
> "attributes": {"adverb": "<adverb>"} if an adverb is present (valid or invalid), otherwise {}.  
> "match": true if the verb is supported and the adverb (if present) is supported for that verb; false otherwise.  
> object:  
> "text": The full object phrase (noun + adjective if present, e.g., "house red").  
> "noun": The corrected base noun.  
> "attributes": {"adjective": "<adjective>"} if an adjective is present (valid or invalid), otherwise {}.  
> "match": true if the noun is supported for the verb and the adjective (if present) is supported for that noun; false otherwise.  
> words: Array of original words from the input.  
> length: Number of words.  
> match: true if both verb and object "match" fields are true; false otherwise.  
> Example Processing  
> Input: "Paitn house red"  
> Split: ["Paitn", "house", "red"]  
> Correct: "Paitn" → "Paint"  
> Entities:  
> Verb: "Paint", no adverb  
> Object: "house" with adjective "red"  
> Verify:  
> "Paint" is supported, no adverb: Verb match: true  
> "house" is supported for "Paint," "red" is supported for "house": Object match: true  
> Output:  
> ```json
> {
>   "sentence": "Paitn house red",

> Input: "Run race sloowly"  
> Split: ["Run", "rase", "sloowly"]

> Verify:  
> "Run" is supported, "slowly" is supported for "Run": Verb match: true

> Input: "Paint car loud"  
> Split: ["Paint", "car", "loud"]  
> Correct: No corrections needed  
> Entities:  
> Verb: "Paint", no adverb  
> Object: "car" with adjective "loud"  
> Verify:  
> "Paint" is supported, no adverb: Verb match: true  
> "car" is supported for "Paint," but "loud" isn’t supported for "car": Object match: false  
> Output:

> Notes  
> If the user provides a custom structure, override the default with it.  
> For unsupported verbs or objects, include them in "text" with match: false.  
> Misspelling corrections are best-effort; prioritize supported terms.*
